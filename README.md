Python script for identifying web hosts from a list of domains/sub-domains it scans for port 80(http service port) and port 443(https service port) then it saves the result to a file named "results.txt"
create a list of domains/sub-domains 
put the specific path of the list for example:
Enter the file specific path: /root/Desktop/subs.txt
Bingo!! it works and the result will be saved to a file in the same directory of the script
